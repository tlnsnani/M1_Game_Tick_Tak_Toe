In reference to our application I see that the following steps of activity are performed:

Starts the game and check for player 1 as 'X' and player 2 as 'O'.

Player X takes the first move and hence player O makes the move later.

Depending on the activity by the players, a situation for the winner is checked and hence the result is displayed.
