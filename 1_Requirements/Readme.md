## Introduction
    Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game that, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. Tic-tac-toe is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media. Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC
  
## Research
Based on the result of research discussed in the previous chapter, the writer
draws some conclusions of teaching present perfect tense by using Tic Tac Toe game.
There are:
a. Teaching present perfect tense by using Tic Tac Toe game can improve
students’ ability in mastery the tense. It has been proved by average score of
post-test of experimental class (75,25) which is higher than post-test of control
class (62,25). This shows that the students of experimental class have improved
their mastery in present perfect tense. Then, it is also proved by examining the
hypothesis that to is higher than ttable (4,21 > 1,69). It means that there is
significant difference of achievement between the students who were taught by
using the Tic Tac Toe game and the students who were taught without the Tic
Tac Toe game.
b. The second year students of SMPN 1 Baitussalam are interested in learning
present perfect tense by using Tic Tac Toe game. It can be seen from the result
of questionnaires and the students’ enthusiast in learning process. In addition,
the result of Questionnaire also shows that the Tic Tac Toe game can help
students in learning present perfect tense well and easily.
c. Most of the students did not find any obstacles in learning perfect tense by using
the Tic Tac Toe game. But, there was only one student who confirmed that he
found obstacles in learning present perfect tense by using Tic Tac Toe game. 
2.The obstacles are the complexity of the rules of the game and limited time in
playing the game.
